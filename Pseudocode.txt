PSEUDOCODE:

- Execute the tester class in the terminal using two command line arguments to denote the input and output files.
	If exactly two arguments were not given, halt the program and print an error message to the console.
- Find the input file in the project directory and open it.
	If a file by the name of the first argument passed in the command line does not exist, halt the program and print an error message to the console.
- Open the file and parse its content.
	If the file has no content whatsoever, halt the program and print an error message to the console.
- Peek at the first element in the file for an integer.
	If it is not an integer (e.g. if it is a double, String, etc.), halt the program and print an error message to the console.
- Analyse the integer found in the file for its value.
	If the value is either under 1 or over 49, halt the program and print an error message to the console.
- Close the input file.
- Open another file with the name of the second argument in the command line to be used for output.
- Take that number found in the input file and use it as the 'n' to find a series of Fibonacci numbers.
- Using a recursive method compute the first 'n' Fibonacci numbers and print them to the output file in a table.
- Record the execution time of the aforementioned step and print it to the output file after the table.
- Using an iterative method compute the first 'n' Fibonacci numbers and print them to the output file in a table.
- Record the execution time of the aforementioned step and print it to the output file after the table.
- Using a fast recursive method compute the first 'n' Fibonacci numbers and print them to the output file in a table.
- Record the execution time of the aforementioned step and print it to the output file after the table.
- Close the output file.
